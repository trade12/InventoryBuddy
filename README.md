InventoryBuddy
==============

Simple mod that allows one user to bind there inventory to a chest (pouch maybe added in the future) so another member can access it and remove and insert items.

This mod is made for those who live together on a server and share items but don't wish to continuously ask for the tool/item back (i speak from experience).

It also allows the inventory to be accessed even when the player is offline.

_________________________________________

Features to be added in the future

- Ability to lock chest and only allow certain people to access it
- A portable pouch version of the chest
